# AirBnB Clone
The goal of this project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

Our application will be composed by:

  * A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell
  * A website that shows the final: static and dynamic
  * A database or files that store data
  * An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and our data
