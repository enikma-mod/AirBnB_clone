# AirBnB Clone
The goal of this project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

Our application will be composed by:

  * A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell
  * A website that shows the final: static and dynamic
  * A database or files that store data
  * An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and our data

# Diagram Overview
We are going to develop the backend as well as the frontend part of the website. The diagram below outlines the entire project and the technologies which will be used.
